### Screenshot

[My final output picture]!(images/Final output.png)
Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Atom tool

### What I learned
This is the first website that I have cloned just by following my instincts and made the output. While building I have learned about different topics in CSS properties like hover, font-family, font-styling, padding and weight that we need to use for the text to make our website look effectively.


### Continued development

But I know that what I have built was just a normal card and it is not that great. So i really want to focus on more topics and want to build more challenges which helps me to develop myself as an developer. In my further projects I want to include bootstrap, java script to make my website even more responsive and user-friendly.

### Useful resources

Apart from this website there are also some other websites like W3 schools, geeksforgeeks and tutorialspoint which helped me to refer to some other topics and also to clear my basic doubts.
